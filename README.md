# WebVPN

### Brief
WebVPN, fully proxy all websites

### Install
npm install

### Run
node main.js

visit [http://www.your_domain.com/](https://www.your_domain.com/)

### Description
WebVPN can "completely and thoroughly" forward and proxy any third-party website. It is not only a VPN on the Web, but also an advanced intranet penetration tool. It can also be used to make a perfect phishing website (because it perfectly forwards the target website and can also add your own code. But I strongly advise you not to do this. Illegal things are not good. I just want to tell you how awesome this WebVPN is).

Believe me, WebVPN is worthy of its name. When you really use it, you will find that it can do a lot of things you have never thought of. Although it is not perfect yet, it has the basic functions it should have.

If you are interested in this project, please join me to make it better and let more people know about its existence.

If it helps you, you can buy me a cup of milk tea. Thank you very much. I spent thousands of hours and a lot of energy on this. I open source it to facilitate everyone who needs it.

### Note
WebVPN 服务运行到一个主域名上，它会把每个目标网址的域名编码后作为 WebVPN 网站的二级域名。目标网址的后缀，则直接放到 WebVPN 网址的后缀。
DNS泛解析是需要的，所以请务必使用SSL通配符证书。对于本机部署来说，自己修改本地DNS就行，可以使用dnsmasq等工具。
