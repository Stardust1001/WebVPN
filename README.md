WebVPN, fully proxy all websites

### Install

### Description
WebVPN can forward and proxy any third-party website "fully and completely". It is not only a VPN on the web, but also an advanced intranet penetration tool. Can also be used to make a perfect phishing site (because it reposts the target site perfectly, while also adding your own code. But I strongly advise you not to do it, illegal things are not good. I just wanted to tell you , how awesome is this WebVPN)

Believe me, WebVPN lives up to its name, and when you actually use it, you will find that it can do a lot of things you never thought possible. Although it is not yet perfect, it has the basic functions it should have.

If you are interested in this project, welcome to join me to make it better and let more people know of its existence.
